# The Chinese Room
## Kat Zhang
Imagine a room where a non-Chinese speaker is left only with instructions for responding to Chinese characters slipped under the door. By following the instructions closely, the non-Chinese speaker can pretend to understand Chinese perfectly. This thought experiment is proposed by the American philosopher, John Searle, to argue the Turing Test is not sufficient: appearance of understanding a language is not equivalent to real understanding.
In this projected, virtual 3D room, at the far end is the viewer's face captured via a web cam and transformed into a drawing made up of the Oracle Bone Script, the earliest known form of Chinese writing. Flowing on the left/right and top/bottom walls of the room are the most common words in English and Chinese, extracted from Google's trillion word corpus.
